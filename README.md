# My personal site

This is my personal website built with Hugo, an open-source static site generator which also acts as a powerful CMS (Content Management System).

The website is built with the intention of showcasing any projects or ideas I might want to share with the world in the form of blogs, and may contain links to affiliate products. 

The blogs are written with Markdown, which then get rendered to HTML with the help of Hugo. The theme used for the website is called "PaperMod", which you can check [here](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) .

You can contribute to this project or even use it as a template to build your own web applications, but try to not copy paste everything.

Tools used:
Hugo as the application framework and Content Management System (CMS)
Netlify to continuously build and deploy the application
