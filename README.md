# My personal site

This is my personal website built with Hugo, an open-source static site generator which also acts as a CMS (Content Management System).

The website is built with the intention of showcasing any projects or ideas I might want to share with the world in the form of blogs, and may contain links to affiliate products. 

The articles are written in Markdown, which then get rendered to HTML with the help of Hugo. The theme used for the website is called "PaperMod", which you can check [here](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/).

## Tools used:
- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) as the website framework and Content Management System (CMS)
- [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) for the website's theme
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to continuously build and deploy the website
