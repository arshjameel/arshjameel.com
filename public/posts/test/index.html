The Modi government has used loopholes within the constitution to employ two kinds of laws to silence its critics—colonial-era sedition laws and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Of the sedition cases filed against citizens for criticizing the government, 96 percent were filed after Modi came to power in 2014. The UAPA on the other hand has allowed the government to designate individuals as terrorists without a specific link to a terrorist organization. Such laws have resulted in raids on news organizations, widespread arrests of journalists on dubious charges, and even the murder of some reporters, the government has forced journalists and individuals to practice a high degree of self-censorship. [2] Even if the government denies it, India’s once noisy and vigorous press has become dull and passive. The current government has also been rumored to have silenced its political opposition during the 2024 elections by arresting key political figures and freezing bank accounts right before the elections. [4] For reasons such as these, the paper proposes how democracy is not working in India as it is expected to.</p><p>Case Study
India gained independence on August 15, 1947, and has been a democratic nation since January 26, 1950. Over the last 74 years, the political background of India has gone through many stages of evolution to create a version of democracy that is uniquely Indian. India’s government is loosely modeled on the British Westminster system. It consists of a president as the head of state; an executive headed by the prime minister; a legislature consisting of a parliament with an upper and lower house (the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha); and a judiciary with a supreme court at its head. 543 members are elected to the Lok Sabha through a general election held every five years. [1]</p><p>India&rsquo;s democracy does not work the same way as it does in the United States. It is somewhat of a hybrid model, practicing democracy with an authoritarian base. Although the government is officially secular, the Indian culture is mostly downstream from religious beliefs, which often influence elections. India’s first two presidents – Rajendra Prasad and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, were Hindu Brahmans, the latter, a distinguished Sanskrit scholar who had lectured at the University of Oxford. The majority ruling party for the first 3 decades was the Indian National Congress (INC). One of INC’s long-standing resolutions had called for reorganizing British provincial borders into linguistic states via the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. Although English and Hindi would remain as the two national languages for official purposes, each of India’s major regional languages would find its administrative authority. As of now, India has 28 states and 8 union territories, with the first state in India to be established based on the language being Andhra Pradesh, created from Telugu-speaking northern districts of the Madras State. [5]</p><p>India as we know it, wasn’t always as it was. It was previously ruled by British colonialists who used their authoritarian powers to rob India of its riches and managed to cause chaos and division based on religion before finally deciding to leave, which led to a very unstable start to India’s future as a self-governing democratic nation. The British rule of India started with the victory of the ‘British East India Company’ in the battle of Plassey, against the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud Daulah, and his allies in the ‘French East India Company’ in 1757. Following this event, the British East India Company, which was formally only interested in the trade of cotton, tea, silk, and opium, started to function as military authority in growing sections of India. The British rule barred Indians from holding high positions in office as they considered them inherently corrupt and untrustworthy. The British ruled with ideas of Eurocentrism and often discriminated against Indians based on religion and caste. A popular example of this is the Indian Mutiny of 1857 where the British used rifle cartridges greased with pig and cow fat against Indian rebels, which were disrespectful to both the Hindu and Muslim communities which largely comprised the Indian population at the time. Britain also used Indians as expendable tools of war and participated in both world wars on India’s behalf without consulting Indian leaders, leading to a combined death count of 147,000 Indian soldiers. [6]</p><p>Although most of India gave in to the British rule during the First World War, many Indians were still desperately eager for Independence and were led in their struggle by an Indian lawyer and political newcomer named ‘Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi’ who advocated for peaceful protests to drive out the Britishers and continued to work with other members of the INC until the end of the Second World War. Gandhi and the INC demanded immediate independence in 1942, and when the demand was rejected, the INC introduced the “Quit India” movement, which was a series of peaceful demonstrations calling for large-scale denial of authority and protests all over the country, calling for the immediate withdrawal of Britain from India. Although the movement slowly fizzled out by 1943, it did succeed in ruining the faith of the Indian public in the British Government. [6]</p><p>Soon after, the Indian National Army (INA) was formed by the Indian revolutionary Subhash Chandra Bose with Indian POWs, Indian expatriates in Southeast Asia, and the Japanese. The INA aimed to inspire public resentment and revolts among the Indian soldiers to defeat the British rule. Although the movement failed to defeat the Britishers by themselves, leading to the trials of the INA soldiers at the Red Fort, it did succeed in inspiring public resentment, leading to mutinies during and after the trial, which also led to public support throughout India. The British rule, losing the trust of the Indian public and fearing further mutinies, coupled with how the government was generally weakened after the war, led to the Britishers finally deciding to end their rule on India. By early 1946, all political prisoners had been released. Pakistan (including modern Bangladesh) was granted independence on 14 August 1947. India was granted independence the following day on 15 August 1947. [7] The INC formed an official government and selected Jawaharlal Nehru as the Prime Minister who represented the nation, thus marking the beginning of India’s democracy.</p><p>By granting the right to vote and education to 100% of the citizens of the country, including women, strengthening and stabilizing civilian rule over the military, and carrying free and fair elections with decades of multiparty competition since the conception of India’s constitution in 1950, one might think India’s democracy is working pretty well. [2] However, India’s democracy unlike its American counterpart, is not concerned with limiting political power and securing public freedom. On the contrary, it is dominated by the idea of constituting and enabling political power and channeling it for socioeconomic reform. This is largely due to circumstances of India’s beginnings, such as the violence seen during the partition of India and Pakistan, the pressures of establishing political supremacy, a largely uneducated and destitute population with limited knowledge or experience of democracy, deep-seated social divisions born from the partition, and in part by the desires of its founding figures, such as their concern with the unification of the nation, their commitment to social reform and justice, and their need to securing political power. Such social-revolutionary zeal had to require significant restrictions on civic freedoms and the coercion of state power to redress socioeconomic inequities, and arguably even to regulate social identities. The constitution thus, right from the outset, prioritized centralization and executive supremacy, pushed for the use of state power and retained the “bureaucratic authoritarianism” of its colonial predecessor. In effect, despite the success of India’s democracy, its constitution enables and underpins a large number of coercive laws that it places at the executive’s disposal, and creates a political structure dedicated to promoting executive power. This has both promoted and constrained Indian democracy in multiple ways, molding it into a distinctive, hybrid form in which a certain authoritarianism is a structural feature [3], indicating that India might still be in its transition phase toward full democracy.
