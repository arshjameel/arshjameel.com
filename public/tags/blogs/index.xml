      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Hello, and a very happy Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been so long since I have written my last blog. So, where have I been? Did I forget about my website? Did I get lazy and break my promise of writing a new blog each week? No, certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off with, I have finally started attending my classes in person after having to stay indoors for basically all of September. As such there was a ton of work to catch up to, to transition back to &amp;ldquo;normalcy&amp;rdquo;. I knew I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get any time off for myself as a result, but I never expected I would be working non-stop for nearly an entire month. Things are still a little hectic, but at least I have some time to start writing blog posts again. So let&amp;rsquo;s get to it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Hello, and a very happy Monday!</p>
<p>It has been so long since I have written my last blog. So, where have I been? Did I forget about my website? Did I get lazy and break my promise of writing a new blog each week? No, certainly not.</p>
<p>To start off with, I have finally started attending my classes in person after having to stay indoors for basically all of September. As such there was a ton of work to catch up to, to transition back to &ldquo;normalcy&rdquo;. I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t get any time off for myself as a result, but I never expected I would be working non-stop for nearly an entire month. Things are still a little hectic, but at least I have some time to start writing blog posts again. So let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>
<p>Firstly, the biggest thing that has been on my mind for the last month is this networking event I am planning on attending this week. I don&rsquo;t have any real work experience, no notable personal projects, and I don&rsquo;t even have proper dress pants to go with my semi-formal outfit. In fact, I downloaded LinkedIn for the first time today while on the bus! I am so unprepared! However, this is exactly what excites me. Here is me, a dumb college student who knows nothing about the world, about to shake hands with seasoned industry professionals. I may be a nobody, but my presence in this event alone will prove to be extremely beneficial to me as it will expose me to corporate culture for the first time. Who knows, the next time I attend an event like this, my familiarity with how these things work might help me communicate better and actually make networks that stick.</p>
<p>Second on the list is obviously my academic work. There have been a ton of things I have experienced over the last week alone. Professors with an attitude, antisocial teammates that do not communicate properly, dealing with a falling out with said teammates and having to search for new people to team up with, catching up on coursework to prepare for upcoming midterms… it&rsquo;s… a lot. But, hopefully, once this networking event is gone out of the way, I can go all in on studying for any exams and assignments that might come my way in the next month.</p>
<p>There is also obviously an elephant in the room. My progress with WebDev. How&rsquo;s that going? Well as much as it is embarrassing to admit, I have yet again failed to continue working on my WebDev journey, and might not make any promises to reverse that for the next two weeks so I can prepare for the midterms I talked about earlier. However, I shall still make efforts to get back into it. If there&rsquo;s one thing I learned while preparing for this week&rsquo;s networking event, is that I am very behind most of my peers, and I do not plan on keeping things that way. There are a lot of things different about this semester, I can feel it. I just need a breather, and then I can make a comeback.</p>
<p>I do apologize if this week&rsquo;s blog post is a little different than usual, but I promise we&rsquo;ll be back to normal next week. So stay tuned! ;)</p>

      <title>Blog #3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a very interesting last week. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, my request for a 4th course for this fall semester was accepted. I was able to promptly register for it as soon as I was given permission. So far this course doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that difficult. It reminds me of a probabilities course I took back in Winter. That was a much harder course and I hope it has prepared me sufficiently for the course I am taking right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a very interesting last week. Let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>Firstly, my request for a 4th course for this fall semester was accepted. I was able to promptly register for it as soon as I was given permission. So far this course doesn&rsquo;t seem all that difficult. It reminds me of a probabilities course I took back in Winter. That was a much harder course and I hope it has prepared me sufficiently for the course I am taking right now.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I&rsquo;m still somewhat afloat with my attempt at staying up-to-date with the other 3 courses I am taking currently. The biggest contributor to this has been the detailed notes I&rsquo;ve been taking from the lecture slides provided. As for the lab work, I am still trying to coordinate with my TAs as I am having difficulties with the installation and usage of the simulation software / IDEs required. The biggest factor preventing me from doing this is the lack of TAs themselves. Apparently, the TAs for one of my courses haven&rsquo;t been decided yet, which means I might miss some of my deadlines by the time a TA is assigned for my class. I&rsquo;m not really sure what I am supposed to do in this situation, but I&rsquo;ll try figuring something out I guess.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to be honest in my journey of career and life development, and so as a way to stay accountable, I want to say I haven&rsquo;t worked on webdev since last week. It&rsquo;s honestly quite disappointing considering I was very excited coming across a course that would help me get started with this. However, because staying up-to-date with my courses while I am on medical leave is pretty stressful by itself, I haven&rsquo;t gotten the time to work on any side projects. Hopefully, the coming week should bring me lots of free time to be able to do exactly this.</p>
<p>With that being said, let&rsquo;s plan what we want to achieve by the next weekend:</p>
<hr>
<p>Plans for next week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join any lab groups that I haven&rsquo;t joined yet and figure out a way to work on them remotely. Similarly for any assignments due that need to be completed with a team.</li>
<li>Try contacting any TAs for help regarding the previous point, and contact a prof directly for the courses whose TAs aren&rsquo;t assigned yet. Similarly for any help regarding the installation of necessary software / IDEs for such lab work.</li>
<li>Better manage time so I can set aside more time to practice webdev.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Blog #2</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/blog2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve made it to another week! I may have delayed making an update for a day or two, but it&amp;rsquo;s the thought that matters. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing from last week&amp;rsquo;s progress report &amp;mdash; I have recovered my campus email address as I said I would, allowing me to contact my professors and other coordinators. This has led to one bad news and one good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I would usually take 5 courses a semester, but I thought of taking 4 courses this time since I would be focussing on my post-surgical recovery. The bad news is that I&amp;rsquo;ve applied to my courses late, which is causing me a little difficulty in registering for that 4th course. The worst case scenario would be that I would have only 3 courses this semester, but hopefully, that should not cause any academic disadvantage for me in the future, other than slightly increasing my workload in a different semester.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Continuing from last week&rsquo;s progress report &mdash; I have recovered my campus email address as I said I would, allowing me to contact my professors and other coordinators. This has led to one bad news and one good news.</p>
<p>The thing is, I would usually take 5 courses a semester, but I thought of taking 4 courses this time since I would be focussing on my post-surgical recovery.

The worst case scenario would be that I would have only 3 courses this semester, but hopefully, that should not cause any academic disadvantage for me in the future, other than slightly increasing my workload in a different semester.</p>
<p>The good news is that the medical leave I had requested after my surgery has resulted in my professors giving me permission to study and participate in their classes from the comfort of my home. Considering how much time I usually waste in commuting, this would hopefully allow me to better focus on my studies. Aside from this, the following are the previous week&rsquo;s highlights.</p>
<hr>
<p>Weekly report:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The decision regarding my request for the 4th course has been pending for the whole week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been permitted to study and work on my labs from home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have made a small project that scrapes information from a CSV file and projects the information on a graph. Working on this project helped me revise some data analysis skills for the first time in almost 2 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing worth showing off, although I hope this has helped me build some foundation for machine learning skills if I ever decide to go down that path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have started an online course to help me learn full-stack development. I&rsquo;ve always thought of society&rsquo;s obsession with ML/AI as a type of &ldquo;shiny object syndrome&rdquo;, with the majority of its fans being non-technical influencers and their followers.</p>
<p>Although it has its use and its progress should be monitored closely, I feel traditional roles such as web development are still just as important, and shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
<p>Not to mention what one learns in University is so out-of-touch with someone&rsquo;s roles in a proper work environment, I decided to turn to online courses while I still have time before my first internship.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Plans for next week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speaking of shiny object syndrome, I seem to be suffering from such a case as well. My decision to learn full-stack development was followed by quite a bit of hesitation, as I was unsure as to what project I wanted to spend the next 4 months on. Since this is the one idea that seems the most possible to act on, I plan to stick to the webdev course I mentioned and hope to make some progress in it.</li>
<li>I want to try setting up the software needed for the lab work in my uni courses. I&rsquo;ve been having some trouble figuring out the process but hopefully, a TA should help me out.</li>
</ol>

      <title>Blog #1</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/blog1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my first blog. For long-time visitors and friends, this certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t my first &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a few long-form essays in the past, but have noticed it takes me a long time to collect interesting ideas and experiences to document them in an essay format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had also gone through a minor cosmetic surgery a while ago. I won&amp;rsquo;t be giving many details about this online for the sake of my privacy, however, the recovery phase requires me to be on a liquid diet until the end of September. This further contributed to my sloth lifestyle, causing me to be unproductive for many consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Welcome to my first blog. For long-time visitors and friends, this certainly isn&rsquo;t my first <em>post</em>.</p>
<p>I have written a few long-form essays in the past, but have noticed it takes me a long time to collect interesting ideas and experiences to document them in an essay format.</p>
<p>I had also gone through a minor cosmetic surgery a while ago. I won&rsquo;t be giving many details about this online for the sake of my privacy, however, the recovery phase requires me to be on a liquid diet until the end of September. This further contributed to my sloth lifestyle, causing me to be unproductive for many consecutive days.</p>
<p>To fix such issues, I have decided to write weekly journals/blogs where I document my general progression in my career and life. This would not only allow me to contribute to my website more frequently but would also help me be more accountable for my lifestyle choices and give readers of my blog a better idea of who I am as a person.</p>
<hr>
<p>With that being said, let us begin discussing our first weekly report:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have modified the look of this site and have better organized the different types of content throughout my site to improve the UI.</li>
<li>I have been able to finish working on <a href="https://github.com/arshjameel/TweetGen">TweetGen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arshjameel/QuoteGen">QuoteGen</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/arshjameel/PyVault">PyVault</a>. Three different personal projects which I have been working on simultaneously for the past one or two weeks, and have uploaded them all on GitHub.</li>
<li>I have passed all courses I had taken in the summer, which helped me fix my CGPA after it had taken a dangerous hit due to my negligence during the winter semester.</li>
<li>I have been able to properly workout today for the first time since my surgery, despite still being on a liquid diet.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Plans for next week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue focusing on my post-surgical recovery and be more consistent with my workouts.</li>
<li>Try recovering my campus email address which was locked for some reason, and finally enable 2FA on it, which I have been neglecting to do so for a long time.</li>
</ul>
