Hello everyone, you are officially reading the first blog of the year!

There's not much news for me to share with you all, although I wish I did. However, if you've been up to date with some 
of my [old blog posts](../blog1), you must know that I underwent a minor cosmetic surgery last summer. But what you all 
might not know is that the procedure was performed in India. 

I didn't say this at the time because I was afraid my professors would assume I was on an extended summer break if they 
had come across my blog, but considering how so many of them don't even bother checking their inboxes, I'd be surprised 
if they would even remember my name, much less finding out about my blog.

Well, regardless, the reason I am saying this is because I'm going back to India for a follow-up surgery. It is a small 
procedure meant to remove a device they put in me to provide some structural support to my face.

The procedure will not cause any noticeable changes to my appearance, and will hopefully be followed by a quick 
recovery. I'll be flying back home by the end of the month, allowing me to catch up on my classes without falling too 
far behind.

Additionally, there is a job fair on my campus in February. I have had my eyes on this event since last November, and I 
am planning on finishing this online full-stack course I told you all about before I fly back home. 

I hope updating my resume with some of the projects I've completed to showcase my skills will make me more attractive 
to the recruiters there.

Whether or not I end up getting a job, setting this deadline for myself can prove to be extremely beneficial since 
I can spend the rest of my semester working on larger projects with my newfound skills, so I am excited regardless of 
the outcome.
