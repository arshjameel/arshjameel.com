Hello and welcome to the last blog of the year!

I hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday. In just a few hours we will enter into 2025!

I'd like to congratulate all those who achieved great things this year! One of the greatest achievements is reaching the end of the year alive and well. For many of us, these holidays can be extremely beneficial for resting and trying to catch up on all the new trends we are noticing in the tech industry.

In case it isn't obvious, I have resumed my webdev journey. Just a few minutes ago, I published a simple sketchpad on GitHub that allows users to create pixel art. It isn't anything crazy, but it is a cute little app and I am proud of it! You can check it out [here](https://arshjameel.github.io/Sketchpad/).

So many of my friends are also spending their holidays working on different technical skills. If I didn't have this excitement of working together and I didn't know that they were also working I would have thought that I was wasting my holidays. I just hope 2025 is the year I, and all my friends, get exciting opportunities in Co-op internships. If not, at the very least, I hope to fill my resume with as many skills and projects as I can.

My friends are all so hardworking, and I want to express how grateful I am to have the friends I have because they keep me motivated to achieve greater heights! I don't have many of them following my GitHub, but I'd like to give a shoutout to those who do below, so I suggest all those reading this blog to go ahead and follow them too:

* [Anique Ali](https://github.com/aniqueali17)
* [Daniel Yonkeu](https://github.com/danielyonkeucheunko)
* [Kshitij](https://github.com/ksmavai)

Once again, I'd like to wish all those reading this blog to have a very happy New Year!
