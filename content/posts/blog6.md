Happy Sunday!

Reading week is finally here, and as always this week has been super hectic. As mentioned in the [previous blog](../blog5), we've had two midterms and two assignments. I also had a lab session which I had to miss because of the extremely disorganized exam schedule given to us. But, I won't complain. The week is finally over and it's time to relax and catch up to any backlogs and strengthen academic foundations.

I have also been revising HTML/CSS fundamentals over the last 2 days and have been banging my head against the wall trying to make sense of [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox). I have finally reached a point where I am confident with the fundamentals, which means I can now tackle the biggest hurdle of my life -- JavaScript. 

I've been trying to practice webdev for a long time so I'm happy that I finally have free time to do so. However, we're gonna take our time with it and not rush things as I also have to focus on academic coursework as I mentioned earlier.

This week will be really pivotal for me if I catch up to my backlogs; otherwise, I will have to continue struggling until the end of the semester. As such, hereâ€™s my plan for the following week:

* Read through lecture slides and assigned textbook for my operating systems course and also start the assignment given to me and my assigned partner for the same course.
* Go through lecture slides for any other course if needed and prepare for my midterms that are scheduled after reading week.
* And obviously, learn the basics of javascript

Just because it's reading week it doesn't mean I have to start getting lenient on myself. This week is going to be really busy just like any other week, and I am excited to welcome it!
