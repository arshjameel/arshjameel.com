Happy Saturday!

It's been a very interesting last week. Let's talk about it.

Firstly, my request for a 4th course for this fall semester was accepted. I was able to promptly register for it as soon as I was given permission. So far this course doesn't seem all that difficult. It reminds me of a probabilities course I took back in Winter. That was a much harder course and I hope it has prepared me sufficiently for the course I am taking right now.

Aside from that, I'm still somewhat afloat with my attempt at staying up-to-date with the other 3 courses I am taking currently. The biggest contributor to this has been the detailed notes I've been taking from the lecture slides provided. As for the lab work, I am still trying to coordinate with my TAs as I am having difficulties with the installation and usage of the simulation software / IDEs required. The biggest factor preventing me from doing this is the lack of TAs themselves. Apparently, the TAs for one of my courses haven't been decided yet, which means I might miss some of my deadlines by the time a TA is assigned for my class. I'm not really sure what I am supposed to do in this situation, but I'll try figuring something out I guess.

Lastly, I want to be honest in my journey of career and life development, and so as a way to stay accountable, I want to say I haven't worked on webdev since last week. It's honestly quite disappointing considering I was very excited coming across a course that would help me get started with this. However, because staying up-to-date with my courses while I am on medical leave is pretty stressful by itself, I haven't gotten the time to work on any side projects. Hopefully, the coming week should bring me lots of free time to be able to do exactly this.

With that being said, let's plan what we want to achieve by the next weekend:

Plans for next week:

* Join any lab groups that I haven't joined yet and figure out a way to work on them remotely. Similarly for any assignments due that need to be completed with a team.
* Try contacting any TAs for help regarding the previous point, and contact a prof directly for the courses whose TAs aren't assigned yet. Similarly for any help regarding the installation of necessary software / IDEs for such lab work.
* Better manage time so I can set aside more time to practice webdev.
