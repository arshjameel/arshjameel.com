Happy Saturday!

Welcome to my first blog. For long-time visitors and friends, this certainly isn't my first *post*. 

I have written a few long-form essays in the past, but have noticed it takes me a long time to collect interesting ideas and experiences to document them in an essay format.

I had also gone through a minor cosmetic surgery a while ago. I won't be giving many details about this online for the sake of my privacy, however, the recovery phase requires me to be on a liquid diet until the end of September. This further contributed to my sloth lifestyle, causing me to be unproductive for many consecutive days.

To fix such issues, I have decided to write weekly journals/blogs where I document my general progression in my career and life. This would not only allow me to contribute to my website more frequently but would also help me be more accountable for my lifestyle choices and give readers of my blog a better idea of who I am as a person.

With that being said, let us begin discussing our first weekly report:
* I have modified the look of this site and have better organized the different types of content throughout my site to improve the UI.
* I have been able to finish working on [TweetGen](https://github.com/arshjameel/TweetGen), [QuoteGen](https://github.com/arshjameel/QuoteGen), and [PyVault](https://github.com/arshjameel/PyVault). Three different personal projects which I have been working on simultaneously for the past one or two weeks, and have uploaded them all on GitHub.
* I have passed all courses I had taken in the summer, which helped me fix my CGPA after it had taken a dangerous hit due to my negligence during the winter semester.
* I have been able to properly workout today for the first time since my surgery, despite still being on a liquid diet.

Plans for next week:
* Continue focusing on my post-surgical recovery and be more consistent with my workouts.
* Try recovering my campus email address which was locked for some reason, and finally enable 2FA on it, which I have been neglecting to do so for a long time.
