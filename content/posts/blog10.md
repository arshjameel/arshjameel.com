Hello everybody!

Sorry for suddenly disappearing for a month, but I'm finally back! I had to take a sudden break to prepare for my final exams. Now that I'm free for the next 2-3 weeks, I don't have any excuses to miss any deadlines for publishing new blog posts.

I will continue making updates on my webdev progression as usual. I will also be posting an article soon, describing the scheduling simulator that I had been working on last month for my operating systems course.

The next blog will be posted next weekend as usual, and until then, I wish everyone reading this a very happy Christmas! I hope you all enjoy these holidays with your family and take some well-deserved break from work and school!
