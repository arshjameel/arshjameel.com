## Who?
My name is Arsh Jameel, but you can simply call me Arsh. I am currently an undergraduate student at Carleton University, pursuing a degree in Computer Systems Engineering. I am a programmer, reader, writer, and an athlete. No I dont run marathons, but I do care about my physical and mental health.

## What?
I am an American-Canadian national, born to Indian immigrants, but grew up in the Middle East. By the nature of my personal life experience, I can not relate to one particular country's culture. As a result, I am constantly in search of who I am and what my role is in society.

## Why?
Taking refuge in the creative freedom of reading, writing and programming, I feel like I get closer to finding the answer to those questions. This blog is meant to be an extension to that creative freedom, serving as a way to showcase my learnings.

## Where?
I do not yet have a newsletter, but if you ever want to get in touch with me, or just want to get to know me better, please follow my socials linked below.
