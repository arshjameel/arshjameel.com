## Welcome
Welcome to my website. My name is Arsh Jameel, but you can simply call me Arsh. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree at Carleton University in Computer Systems Engineering. 

I am a programmer, reader, writer, and an athlete. No, I dont run marathons, but I do care about my physical and mental health.

This blog is meant to be an extension of who I am. Here, you can find my thoughts on technology, self-improvement, or any other topic that interests me.
