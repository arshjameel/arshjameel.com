My name is Arsh Jameel, but you can simply call me Arsh. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree at Carleton University in Computer Systems Engineering. 

I have always been a creative person, but was too nerdy for painting, so was naturally attracted to the world of programming and the idea of how I could create *anything* and was limited *only* by my imagination. 

This desire for creativity also manifested itself in other soft-skills such as reading, writing and working-out for similar reasons. I saw my mind and body as clay that I could mold as I saw fit. 

I decided to build this website so I can share my knowledge and experience with the world and give back to society whatever it has given me.
